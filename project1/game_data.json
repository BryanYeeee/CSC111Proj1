The walls are adorned with posters of your favorite bands and motivational quotes. A neatly made bed occupies one corner, while a cluttered desk covered with textbooks, notebooks, and a dead laptop sits under the window. The soft hum of the mini-fridge adds a soothing background noise. This is where you plan your day, study for exams, and occasionally escape into the world of your favorite novels.",

The ground is paved with cobblestones, and well-tended flower beds add splashes of color to the scenery. Students are scattered around, some engaged in lively conversations on benches, while others are engrossed in their studies under the shade of mature oak trees. The air is filled with the subtle scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. To the north, you see the entrance to the dormitory; to the east lies the library; the cafeteria is to the south; and to the west, you notice the pathway leading to the CS lounge. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves, creating a serene atmosphere that invites you to explore further or simply take a moment to relax.",
